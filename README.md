IBM-Bluemix-UM-Starter
======================

Get started with IBM Bluemix and User Modeling service

After creating an IBM Bluemix free account, build a small Node app to connect to Bluemix Watsonâ€™s User Modeling service and run this Proof of Concept.

##Bluemix requirements
* [Sign-up for an IBM ID](https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=reg) to get access to your Bluemix account. You will be able to run your application from the IBM Cloud Foundry platform.
* You will need to get your account confirmed before having access to your Cloud Foundry account. This can take 24 hours right now.

##Dev Environment setup:
This tutorial assumes you are familiar with Node.js basics. Follow these steps.

* Download and install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) for your system. Scroll down through the readme file to the Installers section for your platform
* Create a local Node.js app with Express
* Add a manifest.yml to the root of the Node app. Copy and paste the following snippet
```
applications:
# the URL for the application will be <host>.<domain>
# in this example, that's <unique-host-name>.mybluemix.net
# Set the host to a unique URL for your app
- host: <unique-host-name>
 # this is the domain for codename:bluemix
 domain: mybluemix.net
 # list services to access
 services:
   - um-service
 # the name of the application that you will see if you type 'cf apps'
 name: <YourApplicationName>
 # look for the files to 'push' in the current directory
 path: .
 # run this command to initiate the application (path to your server.js or app.js or ./bin/www)
 command: node ./bin/www
 # create 1 server instance
 instances: 1
```

##Setup service and publish
* Set API endpoint:

```$ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net```

* Authenticate to Bluemix:

```$ cf login```

* Create service for accessing User Modeling on your Bluemix account - using command line:

```$ cf create-service user_modeling user_modeling_free_plan um-service```

* Push your app to Bluemix to get it published - using command line set to the root of app:

```$ cf push```

##Access your Node.js App on Cloud Foundry
After publishing, your app will be available at <unique-host-name>.mybluemix.net based on the value of <unique-host-name> set in your manifest.yml file.
